Back End will Have the following API
-- data will be parsed using req.body.ttribute or req.param. attribute
1. /login to get token
2. /referesh to refresh expired token
3. /api/user to get user for settings page( to be logged in)
3. /api/actuator to get list of actuators for certain user
4. /api/actuator/:id to get single actuator 
5. /api/actuaator/:id/on to command the actuator on or off to (checks json for fan)
6. /api/sensor
7. /api/sensor/:id 
8. /api/sensor/on/:id
9. /api/sensor/:id/status 

// to be used or called by arduino 
10. /api/nfc/unlocked - to command corresponding led, and fan
11. /api/motion_detected - here backend will use the socket.io to notify flutter app
12. /api/temp_water - here we will continually save the temp data and also use socket.io to notify flutter



Arduino Code will the following API
1. /ping to check on and of
2. /ip to send back the current id 
3. /command/led/:id 
4. /command/fan/:id
5. /command/motion_presence - to turn them on
( once turned on the arduino must send a http request for every intrusion and back end will use the socket.io to notify app)
6./command/nfc - to turn on NFC (arduino must send http request when ever thier is unlocking)
7. /command/temp_water - here the arduino must send the temp and water level every tmie.
